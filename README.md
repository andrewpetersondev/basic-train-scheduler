## Take a look

__[Basic Train Scheduler](https://andrewpetersondev.github.io/basic-train-scheduler/)__

## Overview

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Instructions

### Basic Specs

1. [] When adding trains, administrators are able to submit the following:
    * [] Train Name
    * [] Destination
    * [] First Train Time -- in military time
    * [] Frequency -- in minutes

2. [] This app calculates when the next train will arrive relative to the current time

3. [] Users from many different machines are able to view same train times.

## Bonus

1. [] Consider updating your "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. This is significantly more challenging; only attempt this if you've completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping (and maybe create a second GitHub repo).

2. [] Try adding update and remove buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).

3. [] As a final challenge, make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. You'll need to read up on Firebase authentication for this bonus exercise.

## Status

In Progress.
